# tiny-menu-system
A stupid menu system, written in C.
```sh
bash build.sh        # build the lib
bash build.sh test   # build the test executable
bash build.sh clean  # remove the object file & the test executable
bash build.sh fclean # remove the object file, the lib & the test executable
```

Peep main.c to see how to use this thing.
