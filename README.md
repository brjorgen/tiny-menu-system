# tiny-menu-system
A stupid menu system, written in C.
```sh
# Dynamically allocated implementation (shitty)
bash build.sh        # build the lib
bash build.sh test   # build the test executable
bash build.sh clean  # remove the object file & the test executable
bash build.sh fclean # remove the object file, the lib & the test executable
# stack implementation (deec)
bash build.sh stack		   # build the lib 
bash build.sh stack_test   # build the test executable
bash build.sh stack_clean  # remove the object file & the test executable
bash build.sh stack_fclean # remove the object file, the lib & the test executable

```

Peep main.c to see how to use this thing.
